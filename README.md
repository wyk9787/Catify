# Catify

## App Description
With Catify, the user can upload an image of a stray cat along with the cat's color (options are: black, white, grey, orange, blue, yellow and mixed) and the location in which you found it (represented by latitude and longitude).  
With the uploaded information, the App will return a list of similar cats. The user has two options depending on whether they think any cat in the list is the same cat as the one they just found:  
1. It is the same cat! The user will confirm a cat and the location will be added to the cat's information. The local shelter will send people to rescue the cat if it is found multiple times in the same area.  
2. This is a new cat! The information the user entered will be stored in a new cat entry. The user will also have the chance of naming the cat! The cat's name will also be stored in the cat's entry.
