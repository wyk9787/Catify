# Catify

## App Description
*Catify* is an iOS app to help stray cats find their home and to help you find your new cat. A study in 2016 shows that there is "an estimated 80 million stray and feral cats in the US" and this number continues to increase over the past two years. Unsprayed or unneutered stray or feral cats contribute extensively to this number, which led to our idea of keeping track of stray cats with an application that is accessible to everyone. 

Current features:  
With Catify, the user can upload an image of a stray cat along with the cat's color and the location in which they found it. With the uploaded information, the App will return a list of similar cats based on the cat's location, color and breed information, which is returned from our cat-breed-recognizer. The user has two options depending on whether they think any cat in the list is the same cat as the one they just found.  

* If they believe the cat is in the list, the user will confirm a cat and the location will be added to the cat's information. The local shelter will send people to rescue the cat if it is found multiple times in the same area.  

* If they believe none of the cats in the list matches this cat, they will add it as a new cat into the system and they also get the chance of naming it! The cat's image, location, color and name information will be stored in a new cat entry.  

The user can also get a list of stray cats near them by entering their location.   

Possible future steps include:   

* A user can choose to adopt a cat through its shelter. The shelter will update the cat's information once it is claimed.   

* A user can also adopt a stray cat and contact the shelter to help spay/neuter and vaccine it. The goal is to make adopting a cat easier and safer so that more cats can find a home and more cat lovers find their new cat.  

* Create a cat family network. The user gets to know other people who adopted a cat before and maybe join in a network of cat lovers!  

**Collaboration with local shelters is essential for most of the above features.**
